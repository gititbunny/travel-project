            <h3>Kruger, Home of The Big Five</h3>
            <p>
              Truly the flagship of the South African National Parks, this
              enormous and magnificent park is one of the most popular
              public-entry game parks in the world. Visitors can explore the
              park in their own vehicles, stay at public rest camps, or choose
              exclusive private lodges. It boasts 12 main rest camps, 5 bushveld
              camps, 2 bush lodges, and 4 satellite camps.
            </p>

              Established in 1898 to protect the wildlife of the South African
              Lowveld, Kruger offers a world-class wildlife experience with
              unparalleled diversity. It is home to 336 tree species, 49 fish,
              34 amphibians, 114 reptiles, 507 birds, and 147 mammals, and leads
              in environmental management techniques. The park also preserves
              significant cultural treasures, such as bushman rock paintings and
              archaeological sites like Masorini and Thulamela, reflecting
              centuries of human interaction with the environment and history.
